# Simple NLP project

## Using a Dataset from Yelp:

The Dataset in this NLP project we will be attempting to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.

Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.

Also:

* The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.

* The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users.

* The "useful" and "funny" columns are similar to the "cool" column.
